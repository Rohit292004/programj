GUI components which simplify the development of desktop applications.
From Java2

JAVA SWING
Java Swing is a lightweight Java graphical user interface (GUI) widget toolkit that includes a rich set of 
widgets. It is part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) and includes several packages for developing rich 
desktop applications in Java. Swing includes built-in controls such as  image, buttons, tabbed panes, 
sliders, toolbars, color choosers, tables, and text areas to display HTTP or rich text format (RTF).
Swing components are written entirely in Java and thus are platform-independent.

Swing								vs Applet

Swing is light weight Component.				Applet is heavy weight Component.
Swing have look and feel according to user 
view you can change look and feel using UIManager.		Applet Does not provide this facility.
									
Swing uses for stand lone Applications, 			Applet need HTML code for Run the Applet.
Swing have main method to execute the program.	
Swing uses MVC Model view Controller.				Applet not.
Swing have its own Layout like most popular Box Layout.		Applet uses AWT Layouts like flowlayout.
Swing have some Thread rules.					Applet doesn't have any rule.
To execute Swing no need any browser By which we can 
create stand alone application But Here we have to add container 
and maintain all action control with in frame container.	To execute Applet programe we should need any 
								one browser like Appletviewer, web browser. 
							Because Applet using browser container to run and all 
							action control with in browser container.







Creating a new Project swing project

way1: without IDE(not preferred) //because many compenents and event class not easy to memorize all
step1: Create java frame
Tow ways to create a frame:
By creating the object of Frame class (association)
By extending Frame class (inheritance)
step2:
write swing coding inside the main(), constructor or any other method.
example1/2/3:

way2: with using netbeans/eclipse IDE(preferred)
Creating a new Form
To create a new application project called "MyGUI":
1. Choose File > New Project. Alternately, click the New Project icon in the
toolbar.
2. From the Categories pane select Java and in the Projects pane, choose Java
Application. Click Next.
3. Enter a name (in this case MyGUI) in the Project Name field and specify the
project location by clicking on the Browse button. By default the project is
saved in the NetBeansProjects folder in My Documents and so this is the
default Project location displayed in this field.
4. Ensure that the Set as Main Project checkbox is selected and clear the Create
Main Class field.
5. Click Finish








private void sumBtnActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {                                       
        // TODO add your handling code here:
        double x1=Double.parseDouble(inputTxt1.getText());
        
        double x2=Double.parseDouble(inputTxt2.getText());
        JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this, "Sum="+(x1+x2));
    }
